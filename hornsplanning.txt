Split it up into icons:
------------------
x15 tips - can be tacked on, but need to be placed correctly.
---------30---------up to 30 icons needed, 60ish if use 4/7 instead of 3/5.
x4 lengths  -  (change to 3) (finger-length, 1-2 handspan, 2+ handspans)
x7 curlinesses ( change to 5: straight, light curve, deep curve (<180 degrees), coil, zigjag.)
x2 Angular / smooth curves
------------------ 8 - 12 icons
x4 radials (Triangular, Round, Oval, Spiraling)  (C-shape?  Irregular?)
x2 widths  (narrow / wide)
------------------16 icons
x4 directions  (front, back, out, in. remove sidemounted from code.)
x4 Odd Mounting (Sides, back, unicorn, mohawk)

------------------ : Indicated by special graphics-overrides, or applies to All Horns Equally
XX........: Left Doubled / Right Doubled, Both or neither.  Secondary horn maxlength 1, clone of which horn, etc.
            Dd = left Double, dD = right double, DD = both.  horn 1R +modified 2R, and 1L + modified 2L.
            1?, 2?, 3?:  Whether using horn 1L, 2L, or 3L.   1D, 2d, 3d, etc, count the which-horn, but no doubling.
            ?1, ?2, ?3:                horn 1R, 2R, or 3R    d1, D2, d3, etc, count which horn but no doubling.
            xX : no left horn, only right.   Xx, no right horn, only left.  XD/DX; both horns on same side.
            Total possibilities:  1, 2, 3, D, d, x, X.
            if horn to use is not specified, use #1 by default.
..XX......: Stunted horn, blunted, withered, nub.  Right+Left
            possibilities: SsBbWwNn, Aa, Cc, Dd, Ee, Ff, Gg.
            (something akin to the doubling gene's structure)
....XX....: Keratin, ElectroSensory, sheddable antler, Power-regulating, Balance,
            K/k,     E/e             A/a               P/p               B/b
            Capital = active, lowercase = recessive, can have two separate active genes if desired.
......X...: Angular / smooth curves / Both
            A / S / B
.......X..: Growing in unsafe directions that could impact skin or horn (if length/direction/curliness allows)
            C/E/J/L/N/S/U are safe.  X is not.
            To be in danger, must have X gene, *and* horns shaped in a way that can impact.
            - spiraling: treat curl as 1 greater than it actually is.
            - All Curl > 5
            - Inward, with curl > 2 and length > 1.
            - Back direction, curl > 1, length > 1.
            - side + wide = ear deformity
            - front + wide = forehead deformity
            - Side + in = mild skull deformities.
........X.: Odd Mounting (Sides, back, unicorn, mohawk)  Top/normal
                          S /    B /   U /      M.          TtNn
.........X: Notches / holes, location nonspecific, or Hollowness.
            N/n,      H/h,                             Oo, or none of the above Xx.
            Capital Letter = 1 gap, lowercase letter = several smaller ones.
