  (length * width(n=2,w=3), + curvature.   hollows = * .75.  One Hollow = * 0.35)

ideal icon size seems to be 35x35

Split it up into icons:
---------11-------
x11 tips -
    # P(point), B(bump), b(branching), C(cone), F(flat), H(hook), J(jagged)
    # R(round), S(split), s(spade), L(bolt), p(Pincher)
---------90---------
x4 lengths -
    1 (0-1 handspans, Terezi),
    2 (1-2 handspans, Eridan),
    3 (2-3 handspans, Aradia),
    4 (3+  handspans, Gamzee)
x8 curlinesses
    1 (straight),
    2 (up to 45 degrees),
    3 (90 degrees +/- 45),
    4 ( S-shape curves)
    5 (180 degrees +/- 45),
    6 (270 degrees +/- 45),
    7 (360 degrees +/- 45),
    8 = Back-and-forth waves (Ampora)
x3 Angular / smooth curves
    A = angular
    S = smooth
    B = both
---------24-------
x4 radials
    R round
    O Oval
    T triangular/edged
    S spiraling
    C C-shaped
    I Irregular
x2 widths  (narrow / wide)
    w Wide
    n Narrow
x2 Hollownesses
    H One big hollow
    h several smaller hollows

# Consider replacing this system with a 5x5 grid of horn placement, allowing (centered, Straight Up, normal, Wide, and Side) x (Face, Temple, Ear, Back-diagonal, Back-center)
# Plus a direction-of-curvature:  N/S/E/W, with North being the face, S = Back, E = top of head, W = shoulders.
# Would require an icon for each of 25 locations on a side profile head;
# --------times an arrow pointing each of 4 directions, from each location.
# Total: 100, but only trivially different from eachother.
x4 directions  (front, back, out, in. remove sidemounted from code.)
    F Front
    B Back
    I Inward/upward/towards other horn
    O Outward/downward/away from other horn
x4 Odd Mounting (Sides, back, unicorn, mohawk)
    S Side
    B Back
    U Unicorn
    M Mohawk (combine mohawk/unicorn into C Centered?)

------------------ : Indicated by special graphics-overrides, or applies to All Horns Equally
XX........: Left Doubled / Right Doubled, Both or neither.  Secondary horn maxlength 1, clone of which horn, etc.
            Dd = left Double, dD = right double, DD = both.  horn 1R +modified 2R, and 1L + modified 2L.
            1?, 2?, 3?:  Whether using horn 1L, 2L, or 3L.   1D, 2d, 3d, etc, count the which-horn, but no doubling.
    0       ?1, ?2, ?3:                horn 1R, 2R, or 3R    d1, D2, d3, etc, count which horn but no doubling.
            xX : no left horn, only right.   Xx, no right horn, only left.  XD/DX; both horns on same side.
            Total possibilities:  1, 2, 3, D, d, x, X.
            if horn to use is not specified, use #1 by default.
..XX......: Stunted horn, blunted, withered, nub.  Right+Left
    4       possibilities: SsBbWwNn, Aa, Cc, Dd, Ee, Ff, Gg.
            (something akin to the doubling gene's structure)
....XX....: Keratin, ElectroSensory, sheddable antler, Power-regulating, Balance,
            K/k,     E/e             A/a               P/p               B/b
            Capital = active, lowercase = recessive, can have two separate active genes if desired.
......X...: Angular / smooth curves / Both
     0       A / S / B
.......X..: Growing in unsafe directions that could impact skin or horn (if length/direction/curliness allows)
            C/E/J/L/N/S/U are safe.  X is not.
            To be in danger, must have X gene, *and* horns shaped in a way that can impact.
     0      - spiraling: treat curl as 1 greater than it actually is.
            - All Curl > 5
            - Inward, with curl > 2 and length > 1.
            - Back direction, curl > 1, length > 1.
            - side + wide = ear deformity
            - front + wide = forehead deformity
            - Side + in = mild skull deformities.
........X.: Odd Mounting (Sides, back, unicorn, mohawk)  Top/normal
     0                    S /    B /   U /      M.          TtNn
.........X: Notches / holes, location nonspecific, or Hollowness.
    0       N/n,      H/h,                             Oo, or none of the above Xx.
            Capital Letter = 1 gap, lowercase letter = several smaller ones.
