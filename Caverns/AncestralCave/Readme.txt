Blood codes and castes: 
	Pure Caste Only	Pretty Close		More  mutations, still probably OK.				Mucky...
Maroon:	RR, 	RRr, Rrr, Rr, rr 		RRR, RRG, RRB^, RRr, RRg, RRb^, Rrr, Rrg, rrr, rrg, rrb^, rr	/
Bronze:	Rg,	Rgg,				rgg, rg,							Rgb^
Gold:	RG,	RGr, RGg			RGG,								RGB, RGb^
Lime:	Gr,	Grr, Grg			/								Grb^
Olive:	GG,	Gg, GGg, Ggg, GGr, GGb, Ggb, 	GGG, GGB, ggg, gg						/

Indigo:	Br^	Brr^^, Brb^			/								Brg^
Violet:	RB^^	RBr^^, RBb^^			RBB								RBg^
Tyrian:	Rb^^	Rbb^^				/								/
VANTAS:	rb*^	rbb^^				/								/
^ = some seadweller traits possible.  "Beachdweller".
^^ = full seadweller by default
* Vantas is currently treated as being between maroon and tyrian, because this is the most rare and least likely blood code.  If you wish to modify this, he would also work well as a "rrg", "rrr", "rrb", "rbb", etc.


    "sea": "Beachdweller",
"Seadweller", "Landdweller", or "Beachdweller".  To be enhanced later.

    "powers": "Voodoo",
"Voodoo" (indigo), "Psychic"(maroon through blue), "Eldritch" (violet/tyrian/any), or None (any).

    "hornL": "35RBn.f point",
    "hornR": "35RBn.f point", (2-3 handspans long, 270 degree curl, round cross-section, normal width, straight point tip.  Aradia's horns)

Length:  1 (0-1 handspans, Terezi), 2 (1-2 handspans, Eridan), 3 (2-3 handspans, Aradia), or 4 (3+ handspans, Gamzee)
Curliness:  1 (straight), 2 (up to 45 degrees), 3 (90 degrees +/- 45), 4 (180 degrees +/- 45), 5 (270 degrees +/- 45), 6 (360 degrees +/- 45), 7 = Back-and-forth waves (Ampora)
Cross-section shape: R = Round (default), O = Oval, T = Triangular, S = spiraling goatdad-like
Primary Growth Direction:  F = Forwards toward face, B = Backwards towards back of head, O = Outwards towards ears (usually up), I = Inwards towards eachother (usually up).
Width:  n = Normal Base (Terezi), w = Wide Base (Nepeta)
Tip Direction:  F = forward/straight out in the horn's growth direction like Sollux, s = sideways, b = backwards opposite of growth direction (like Kanaya's hook horn)
Tip Shape:  "point" (default), "cone" (equius), "spade", "pincher" (vriska's cupped horn), "jagged" (equius's broken horn), "round" (Karkat)
