On-spectrum:  RR (Maroon), Rg (Bronze), RG (gold), Gr (lime), GG (Olive), Jade (Gb), Teal (GB), Cerulean (Bg), Blue (BB), Indigo (Br), Violet (RB), Tyrian (Rb), Vantas Red (rb).

Approximate smooth spectrum: 
rb (Vantas), rrb, RRR, RR (maroon), Rr, RRr, Rrr, rrr, rr, rrg, RRg, Rrg, RRG, Rgb, Rg(bronze), Rgg, RGr, RG (gold), rgg, rg, RGB, RGb, RGg, RGG, Grr, Gr(lime), Grb, GGr, GG(olive), Gg, Ggg, Ggg, GGG, ggg, gg, GGb, Ggb, GGB, Gb(jade), Gbb, gbb, gb, GBg, GBr, GB(teal), GBb, GBB, Bgg, Bgb, Bg(cerulean), BBg, BB(blue), Bb, BBb, Bbb, BBB, bbb, bb, BBr, Brb, Brg, Br(Indigo), RBB, Brr, rbb, RBb, RBg, RB(violet), RBr, Rbb, Rb(tyrian), and the very cullworthy ones between tyrian and maroon, RRB, RRb, rrb.

Most hues are land-dwellers by default.
Seadwellers by default: RB, Brr, RBr, RBb, Rbb, rbb.
Beachdwellers (often mixed): Br, Brb, Rgb, RGB, RGb, Grb, GBr, Brg, RBg, rb, RRB, RRb, rrb.

^ = some seadweller traits possible.  "Beachdweller".
^^ = full seadweller
* Vantas is currently treated as being between maroon and tyrian, because this is the most rare and least likely blood code.


    "sea": "Beachdweller",
"Seadweller", "Landdweller", or "Beachdweller".  To be enhanced later.

"Voodoo" (indigo), "Psychic"(maroon through blue), "Eldritch" (violet/tyrian/any), or None (any).

    "hornL": "35RBn.f point",
    "hornR": "35RBn.f point", (2-3 handspans long, 270 degree curl, round cross-section, normal width, straight point tip.  Aradia's horns)

Length:  1 (0-1 handspans, Terezi), 2 (1-2 handspans, Eridan), 3 (2-3 handspans, Aradia), or 4 (3+ handspans, Gamzee)
Curliness:  1 (straight), 2 (up to 45 degrees), 3 (90 degrees +/- 45), 4 (180 degrees +/- 45), 5 (270 degrees +/- 45), 6 (360 degrees +/- 45), 7 = Back-and-forth waves (Ampora)
Cross-section shape: R = Round (default), O = Oval, T = Triangular, S = spiraling goatdad-like
Primary Growth Direction:  F = Forwards toward face, B = Backwards towards back of head, O = Outwards towards ears (usually up), I = Inwards towards eachother (usually up).
Width:  n = Normal Base (Terezi), w = Wide Base (Nepeta)
Tip Direction:  F = forward/straight out in the horn's growth direction like Sollux, s = sideways, b = backwards opposite of growth direction (like Kanaya's hook horn)
Tip Shape:  "point" (default), "cone" (equius), "spade", "pincher" (vriska's cupped horn), "jagged" (equius's broken horn), "round" (Karkat)
